# Chatroom App

Simple chat-room app to practice realtime user interaction with React, Node.js, and Socket.io.

## Notes

No CSS/styling, I just wanted to learn fundamentals of Socket.io and a Node.js backend for some other project(s) I'm working on.

Room code can be any set of characters.

## Run
.\server
```
npm start
```

IMPORTANT: RUN CLIENT ON LOCALHOST:3000
.\client
```
npm start
```

## Tutorial

Follows this tutorial by PedroTech, although I made some modifications:

## Bugs/Issues

Received message is displayed twice (only for receiving user).

Multiple users can have the same name.

Room code can be any set of characters (leads to complications/security issues)
